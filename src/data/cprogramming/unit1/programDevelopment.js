      question: "Which stage converts source code into object code?",
      options: [
        "Editing",
        "Compilation",
        "Linking",
        "Execution"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Compilation is the stage where source code is translated into object code."

      question: "Which type of error is detected at compile time?",
      options: [
        "Logical error",
        "Runtime error",
        "Syntax error",
        "Arithmetic error"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Syntax errors are detected by the compiler during the compilation phase."

      id: 33,
      question: "Which type of error produces incorrect output without stopping program execution?",
      options: [
        "Syntax error",
        "Runtime error",
        "Logical error",
        "Linker error"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Logical errors produce incorrect results but don't stop execution - they are errors in program logic."
    },

      id: 34,
      question: "Which error is the most difficult to detect during program execution?",
      options: [
        "Syntax error",
        "Runtime error",
        "Logical error",
        "Link-time error"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Logical errors are most difficult to detect as the program runs without errors but produces wrong results."
    },

      id: 35,
      question: "What is a syntax error?",
      options: [
        "Error in program logic",
        "Error in grammar/rules of language",
        "Error during execution",
        "Error in output"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Syntax error is a violation of the grammar rules of the programming language."

      question: "When do runtime errors occur?",
      options: [
        "During compilation",
        "During linking",
        "During program execution",
        "During editing"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Runtime errors occur during program execution, such as division by zero or invalid input."

        "Coding",
        "Testing"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Program development starts with analyzing the problem and designing an algorithm."

        "Compiling code",
        "Testing output"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Debugging is the process of finding and removing errors (bugs) from a program."
