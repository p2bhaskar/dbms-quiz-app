      question: "Which component of a computer system is responsible for executing instructions?",
      options: [
        "Memory",
        "Input device",
        "Central Processing Unit",
        "Secondary storage"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is responsible for executing instructions and processing data."

      question: "Which of the following is not a part of CPU?",
      options: [
        "ALU",
        "Control Unit",
        "Register",
        "Hard Disk"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Hard Disk is a secondary storage device, not a part of the CPU. CPU consists of ALU, Control Unit, and Registers."

      question: "Which memory is volatile in nature?",
      options: [
        "ROM",
        "Hard Disk",
        "Cache memory",
        "Pen drive"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Cache memory is volatile and loses its data when power is turned off. ROM and storage devices are non-volatile."
    },

      id: 4,
      question: "Which memory stores programs currently being executed?",
      options: [
        "Secondary memory",
        "ROM",
        "RAM",
        "Flash memory"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "RAM (Random Access Memory) stores programs and data currently being executed by the CPU."
    },

      id: 5,
      question: "Which of the following is not an input device?",
      options: [
        "Keyboard",
        "Mouse",
        "Scanner",
        "Monitor"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation: "Monitor is an output device that displays information. Keyboard, Mouse, and Scanner are input devices."

      question: "What is primary memory?",
      options: [
        "Hard disk storage",
        "Main memory directly accessible by CPU (RAM/ROM)",
        "External storage devices",
        "Backup storage"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Primary memory includes RAM and ROM, which are directly accessible by the CPU for fast data access."
    },

        "Register",
        "Cache"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The Control Unit manages and coordinates data flow between CPU and other computer components."
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: "Which performs arithmetic and logical operations?",
      options: [
        "Control Unit",
        "ALU",
        "Register",
        "Memory Unit"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) performs all arithmetic and logical operations in the CPU."

    {
      id: 9,
      question: "What type of memory is ROM?",
      options: [
        "Volatile",
        "Non-volatile",
        "Temporary",
        "Virtual"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "ROM (Read-Only Memory) is non-volatile memory that retains data even when power is off."

      question: "Which storage has the fastest access time?",
      options: [
        "Hard Disk",
        "RAM",
        "Cache",
        "Secondary storage"
      ],
